/** @file gsExport.h

    @brief Handles compiler definitions for G+Smo on MS Windows

    Preprocessor/compile definitions on MS Windows should be set as
    follows:
    
    - Define GISMO_BUILD_LIB when building or consuming the shared or
      static library. Otherwise a pure template build will take place
      (GISMO_BUILD_LIB is set in gsCore/gsConfig.h when G+Smo is
      compiled/installed as a shared library).

    - Do not define gismo_EXPORTS when consuming G+Smo as a shared DLL
      library (this is only defined during build).
    
    - Define gismo_STATIC when building/consuming G+Smo as a static
      library (by default gismo_STATIC is not defined).
    
    
    This file is part of the G+Smo library.
