/** @file gsExport.h

    @brief Handles shared library creation

    By default no symbols are exported in the shared library. Symbols
    that have to be exported must be marked with GISMO_EXPORT. Symbols
    that should not be exported can be marked with GISMO_LOCAL.
    Also:

    - When building the shared library, gismo_EXPORTS must be defined,
      but NOT when consuming G+Smo as a shared library

    - When building the static library, gismo_STATIC must be defined
    
    - If GISMO_BUILD_LIB is defined when building or consuming the shared or
      static library. Otherwise a pure template build will take place
      (GISMO_BUILD_LIB is set in gsCore/gsConfig.h when G+Smo is
      compiled/installed as a shared library).

    This file is part of the G+Smo library.
