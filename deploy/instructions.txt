Assuming that you have the source tree at /path/to/gismo, here is how
to use G+Smo in your application:


* Choose a folder for building (eg. subfolder ./build inside root
  source folder):

cd /path/to/gismo 
mkdir build
cd build


* Configure and install on a predefined location
  (eg. ./build/install for demonstration):

cmake ../ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=./install -DGISMO_EXAMPLES=OFF
make -j2 install


* Solution 1: use the provided main.cpp and CMakeLists.txt (recommended)

Copy the provided "CMakeLists.txt" and main.cpp to a folder of your
choice. In that folder issue:

cmake . -Dgismo_DIR=/path/to/gismo/build/install

If can also point directly to the build folder (if install was not executed):

cmake . -Dgismo_DIR=/path/to/gismo/build

If the configuration is successfull, hen typing "make" should create
the binary file "main", which can be executed as:

$ ./main
Hello G+Smo.

Note: On Windows, use the graphical too cmake-gui to configure and compile.


* Solution 2: use the provided main.cpp and makefile (linux only)

Copy the provided "Makefile" and main.cpp to a folder of your
choice. You need to update the variable GISMODIR to point to your
install directory where G+Smo is found:

GISMODIR :=/path/to/gismo/build/install

Then typing "make" should create the binary file "main", which can be
executed as:

$ ./main
Hello G+Smo.
