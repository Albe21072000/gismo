  Here is an example of how to create a knot
  vector and a b-spline basis, followed by uniform refinement.

  \include bspline_basis.cpp
  Output: \verbinclude bspline_basis.out

  And here is an example of how to compute the Greville
  abscissae, and evaluate the basis on them.

  \include bspline_greville.cpp
  Output: \verbinclude bspline_greville.out
